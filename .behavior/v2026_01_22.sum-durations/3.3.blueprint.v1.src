propose a blueprint for how we can implement the wish described
- in .behavior/v2026_01_22.sum-durations/0.wish.md

with the domain distillation declared
- in .behavior/v2026_01_22.sum-durations/3.2.distill.domain._.v1.i1.md (if declared)

follow the patterns already present in this repo

---

enforce thorough test coverage for proof of behavior satisfaction
- unit tests for all domain logic
- integration tests for all repo <-> access boundaries (os, apis, sdks, daos, etc)
- integration tests for all end <-> end flows
- acceptance tests for core blackbox behaviors

---

include a treestruct of filediffs

**legend:**
- `[+] create` — file to create
- `[~] update` — file to update
- `[-] delete` — file to delete


---

include a treestruct of codepaths


---

remember, the purpose of the blueprint is to declare what the execution will adhere to

we want to see
- what contracts will be used
- how domain.objects and domain.operations are decomposed and recomposed
- what the codepaths are, their ease of maintenance and readability
