and other references to the IsoDuration standard

we want this lib to support both the devexp convinient IsoDuration object it supports today

as WELL as the iso duration words syntax

e.g.,

type IsoDurationWords = `PT${string}` (ideally, we can use a union to constrain it to all the valid patterns)

type IsoDurationShape = what we have today

then

type IsoDuration = IsoDurationWords | IsoDurationShape

and our operations and guards shoudl be able to handle both of them isomorphically

---

that way, users can specify durations in whichever format is most convinient at that time

e.g.,

const duration: IsoDuration = 'PT5S` // valid

const duration: IsoDuration =  { seconds: 5 } // valid
