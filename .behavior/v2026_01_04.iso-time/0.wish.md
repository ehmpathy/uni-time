cutover to `iso-time` pattern

1. rename package to `iso-time`

2. rename domain objects to `iso-time` format

i.e.,

1. UniDateTime -> IsoTimestamp (w/ alias of IsoStampTime and alias of IsoTimeStamp)
2. UniDate -> IsoDatestamp (w/ alias of IsoStampDate and alias of IsoDateStamp)
3. UniMonth -> IsoMonthStamp
3. UniYear -> IsoYearStamp
4. Time -> IsoTimeOnwall
5. IsoMonthOnwall
6. IsoYearOnwall

where

Stamp = the exact, universal instant that a time occurred

Onwall = a recurrent case in time

---

e.g.,

IsoMonthStamp = yyyy-MM
IsoMonthOnwall = MM

---

where Onwall term comes from "wallclock" which comes from "clock on wall"

---
